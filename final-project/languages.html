	<div class = "infobox"><strong>Kanamoji</strong>
		<p>Kanamoji is the name given to the two Japanese alphabets: Hiragana and Katakana.</p>

	
	<p><em>Hiragana</em></p>
	There are 46 Hiragana characters in the Japanese alphabet. They are used to write Japanese native words that do not have a way to write them in Kanji. They are also used as particle markers in the Japanese language.
	<p><em>Katakana</em></p>
	For each of the 46 Hiragana characters there is an equivalent Katakana character. Each Katakana character is pronounced the exact same as its respective Hiragana character. Katakana characters, however, are used when writing <em>loan words</em> or non native Japanese words that have been derived from a foreign language.
	</div> <br/><br/>
	<div class = "infobox"><strong>Kanji</strong><br/><br/>
		Kanji are one of the three main parts of the Japanese writing system along with Hiragana and Katakana. They consist of a whole bunch of Chinese characters that were adopted into the Japanese writing system.
	Since Kanji came from Chinese characters there basically became two ways to pronounce the same characters.</p>
					<p><em>Kun Reading</em></p>
					<p>This is the way the Japanese pronounced it before they started using Kanji. So the way you can pronounce the symbol "山" using the Kun reading is "yama".</p>
				<p><em>On Reading</em></p>
				<p>This is the way the Chinese pronounced it and the Japanese adopted. So the way you can pronounce the symbol "山" using the On reading is"san".</p>
